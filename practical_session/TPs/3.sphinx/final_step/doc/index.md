# Welcome to splinart's documentation!

splinart is a package used for a tutorial which explains how to do the Python packaging using

- [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
- [conda build](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/recipe.html)
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
- [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)
- [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)

And automate the process to distribute this package using github.

The original idea of splinart comes from the great [invonvergent](http://inconvergent.net/generative/sand-spline/) website.

If you want to install splinart:

```
pip install splinart
